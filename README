== Tool to download latest *stable* source ==

Usage:

    ./srcget.sh <name>

i.e.:

    ./srcget.sh zlib

* Needs:

- wget
- awk

* Configuration:

- profile in profiles dir
- awk filter

* Todo:

- groups/tags/categories
- report information instead of actual download
- dependency support
- improve version checking, most of the filters rely on very simple checks
- plan for python migration
- build options
- signal handling... control-c is not handled correctly right now
- support notifications (on failure / new versions)
